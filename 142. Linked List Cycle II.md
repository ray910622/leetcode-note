## Initial Solution
1. Use two pointers: `fast` and `slow`, to detect whether a cycle exists.
  - If there is no cycle, return `nullptr`.
3. If a cycle is detected, determine its length (`cycleLen`).
4. For each node in the list, check if it is part of the cycle.
   - Move the pointer `cycleLen` steps forward; if it returns to the same node, this is the cycle's entry point.
5. Return the first node that satisfies the condition in step 3.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next)
            return nullptr;
        ListNode* slow = head->next;
        ListNode* fast = head->next->next;

        while (slow != fast) {
            if (!fast || !fast->next)
                return nullptr;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        int cycleLen = 1;
        for (slow = slow->next; slow != fast; slow = slow->next) {
            cycleLen++;
        }

        for (ListNode* cur = head; cur != fast; cur = cur->next) {
            slow = cur;
            for (int i = 0; i < cycleLen; i++) {
                slow = slow->next;
            }
            if (slow == cur)
                return cur;
        }
        return fast;
    }
};
```
## Note 

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`. This is not optimal.


## Second Solution
1. Use `fast` and `slow` pointers to detect whether a cycle exist.
   - If `fast` reachs `nullptr`, there is no cycle, so return `nullptr`.
2. Reset `slow` to `head`, then move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time.
3. When `slow = fast`, the meeting point is the entry of the cycle.
   - Since the distance from `head` to the cycle entry is equal to the distance from the meeting point to the cycle entry.
   - Why?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next)
            return nullptr;
        ListNode* slow = head->next;
        ListNode* fast = head->next->next;

        while (slow != fast) {
            if (!fast || !fast->next)
                return nullptr;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

       
        slow = head;
        while(slow != fast){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```
## Note 
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`.
- Space Complexity:" `O(1)`.
- The algorithm is known as **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**.

### Why?
Suppose: 
- $x$: The distance from `head` to the cycle entry.
- $y$: The distance from the cycle entry to the meeting point.
- $z$: The distance from the meeting point back to the cycle entry.
- $n$: The number of full cycles `fast` completes before meeting `slow`.

The `slow` pointer move $x+y$ steps, while the `fast` pointer move $x+y+n(y+z)$ steps.\
Since `fast` moves twice as fast than `slow`, it satisfies the equation:\
$$2(x+y) = x+y+n(y+z)$$\
$\Rightarrow x+y = n(y+z)$\
Solving for $x$\
$\Rightarrow x = (n-1)\times(y+z)+z$\
Here $n-1$ is the number of cycles that `fast` move before meeting `slow`.\
Hence, if `slow` move $x$ steps from `head`, while `fast` move $z$ steps (competing some additional cycles), they will meet at the cycle entry.
