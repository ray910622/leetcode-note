## Initial Solution
1. Create three pointers to track consecutive nodes, then iterate until the end.
2. Since the loop terminates when `next = nullptr`,after while loop finish, the `next` pointer of the last node has not been assigned to the second-to-last node.
Note that the edge case where the input is an empty list should be handled first; otherwise, `next = head->next` will cause a compilation error.\

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;

        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        ListNode* next = head->next;
        while (next) {
            cur->next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = next;
            next = next->next;
        }
        cur->next = prev;
        return cur;
    }
};
```

## Improved Note
If we change the order of the instructions in the loop, we can eliminate the need to handle the edge case separately and simplify the second step mentioned above.
1. Save `temp = cur->next` to store the next node before modifying `cur`.
2. Change `cur->next` to point to the previous node.
3. Move `prev` and `cur` to the next node.
4. Loop until `cur == nullptr`, which means `cur` has reached the end of the list.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        ListNode* temp;
        while (cur) {
            temp = cur->next;
            cur->next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = temp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```
