## Initial Solution
1. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, for the first and last characters in the vector `s`.
2. Swap the characters at `left` and `right` indices, continuing until `left >= right`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size()-1;
        while(left < right){
            char c = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = c;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
};
```

## Note
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$, in-place algorithm.
